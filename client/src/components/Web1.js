      At Healthline Nutrition, we want to help you eat food that makes you feel good. Looking at science is always where we start, but we understand that real-life eating doesn’t fit some perfect nutrient pattern. Here’s how you can refresh your eating habits while still enjoying your meals.<br />
      {/* Continue with the rest of the text, breaking lines as needed */}
      <br />Here’s to ditching resolutions, in favor of refreshing your eating habits in 2023.<br />
      <br />Almost every January, without fail, people become interested in nutrition, health, and wellness.
       There are countless resolutions around weight loss, specific eating patterns, fitness goals, and more.<br /><br />
       While I love to see the enthusiasm around taking better care of yourself, all too often, it starts with eliminating countless foods and hitting the gym 7 days a week.
       The lofty start may sound great but tends to fizzle out after a couple of weeks.<br /><br />

Instead of banishing sugar, carbs, or bread — what if you focused on small, positive changes you could make? Swaps that may not feel as significant but are much more likely to be sustainable.<br /><br />

It’s estimated that only about 9% of people stick to their resolutions every year. Why not try a healthy refresh instead? It’s not as exciting, but getting back to basics is important.<br /><br />

If you’re feeling confused about where to start, you’re not alone. Almost everyone has an opinion about nutrition, and it’s not always — err, rarely — based in evidence.<br /><br />

On social media, it can be overwhelming to sift through nutrition information and figure out what’s true and what makes sense for you. I encourage you to start with what the science says and also start small.<br /><br />

New researchTrusted Source was just published, showing how important hydration is for healthy aging, so drink more water (perhaps a new water bottle will help motivate you).<br /><br />

We know that sleep is important for overall health and impacts your appetite and food cravings (try these science-based tips for better sleep).<br /><br />

Almost 90% of usTrusted Source aren’t eating the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables, but we have some creative and simple ways to help you get your fill.<br /><br />

If you’re already checking those boxes, and getting some movement in, good for you. Think about other small ways to refresh your eating habits. Maybe you make it a goal to try one new food a week, eat protein-rich foods at most meals and snacks, cook more at home, or meal prep on Sundays.<br /><br />

Notice how most of the small changes I mention are positive. They’re foods or habits you can add to your day. I don’t like restriction or deprivation, but I believe that adding some good stuff can naturally help crowd out other behaviors.<br /><br />
      
      I hope when you come to Healthline nutrition, it feels like you’re sitting down for a cozy, comforting, and balanced meal with a friend who happens to know a lot about nutrition science.<br />
