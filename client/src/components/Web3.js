    Somehow, trips to the grocery store have become complicated. Even if you find every ingredient on your list, do you feel confident about what it does or doesn’t do for your body? <br /> <br />

With buzzwords like “adaptogens” and more sources of antioxidants and protein than you ever knew existed floating around, it can be hard to keep it all straight.

What if you had a clear-cut, skimmable glossary to help you figure out what exactly you’re looking for and consuming? Good news—we made one! <br /> <br />

We scoured the Internet, consulted with our medical team, and even asked you about the under-the-radar ingredients you wish you knew more about.

Keep this guide handy when perusing the grocery store, and you’ll be armed with the knowledge you need to make informed, healthy food choices.</div>
