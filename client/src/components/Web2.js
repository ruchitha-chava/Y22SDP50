    <br /><br /> Nearly everyone has an answer to the question "what’s your favorite food?." <br /><br />

It’s easy to see why: humans are wired to derive pleasure from food. In fact, for many, eating ranks among the greatest pleasures in life!<br /><br />

Besides making mealtimes an enjoyable experience, taking pleasure from food also has significant benefits for health. Savoring food supports digestion, can help improve your relationship with food, can help overcome disordered eating and more.<br /><br />

In some cases, getting enough “vitamin P” (or perhaps vitamin mmmm) is just as important as the contents of your plate. Read on to dive into the tasty delights of why pleasure matters for food.<br /><br />

        <strong>The psychology behind eating for pleasure</strong><br />
      </div><br /><br />
      For years, researchers have studied the science behind eating for pleasure. Their findings are intriguing and largely encouraging.<br /><br />

Physiologically, the pleasure people derive from food occurs both in our mouths and in our brains.<br /><br />

“Pleasure of any kind, including pleasure from food, leads to a release of dopamine in the brain,” explains therapist, dietitian, and Certified Body Trust provider Aleta Storch, RDN, MHC, of Wise Heart Nutrition and Wellness.<br /><br />

“Dopamine is often referred to as the ‘feel good hormone’ because it activates the reward pathways in the brain, which helps to promote happiness, calmness, motivation, and focus,” she says.<br /><br />

In fact, some older 2011 researchTrusted Source indicates that people with obesity may have disrupted dopamine sensitivity, leading them to overeat to achieve adequate pleasure from food.<br /><br />

When brain chemistry is working properly, however, our enjoyment of food can lead to physical benefits.<br /><br />

“When we enjoy the food we are eating and stimulate dopamine, we actually digest and metabolize it more effectively,” says Storch. “When we’re relaxed in response to having a pleasurable eating experience, our nervous system goes into rest and digest mode, which allows us to fully break down and utilize the nutrients from the foods we eat.”<br /><br />

Eating for pleasure could promote healthier eating too.

A large systematic review from 2020Trusted Source examined 119 studies about the connection between food enjoyment and a healthy diet. Fifty-seven percent of the studies found favorable associations between eating pleasure and dietary outcomes.<br /><br />

One study from 2015Trusted Source, for example, associated greater eating pleasure with higher nutritional status. Other studiesTrusted Source have emphasized the importance of taking pleasure from healthy foods to promote a nourishing, balanced diet.<br /><br />

“There’s this belief that ‘healthy’ food has to be bland or it doesn’t taste good, but that’s just not true,” says dietitian and certified intuitive eating counselor Sarah Gold Anzlovar, MS, RDN, LDN. “When we eat food that we enjoy, satisfaction increases, which can actually improve diet quality and reduce the chance of overeating or binge episodes.”<br /><br />
