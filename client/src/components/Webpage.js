            Nutritionists deal with general nutritional aims and behaviors, as opposed to dietitians,
            who are qualified to diagnose eating disorders and design diets to address particular medical diseases.
            Nutritionists are frequently employed in schools, hospitals, cafeterias, nursing homes, and athletic organizations.

        </AccordionSummary>
        <AccordionDetails>
          <Typography>
          Unsaturated fats, such as monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, are considered healthy since they can reduce your risk of heart disease or stroke. Think olive, canola, peanut, and sunflower oils, as well as avocados and most nuts, for monounsaturated fats. Corn and soybean oils, as well as walnuts, sesame, pumpkin, and flax seeds, contain polyunsaturated fats. In salmon, mackerel, tuna, and trout, omega-3 fatty acids are a form of polyunsaturated fat. </Typography>

          Probiotics, which are tiny bacteria found in fermented foods such as yogurt, may help with digestion, regularity, and general immune health. Prebiotics can influence the formation of immune-boosting beneficial bacteria in your gastrointestinal system. </Typography>
